                                    blog post</a> if you would like a more indepth explanation on SAT and SAT solvers. </p>

                            <h2>What is the Boolean Satisfiability Problem?</h2>
                            <p>The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is the problem of determining if a propositional
                                statement is satisfiable. A propositional statement is satisfiable when it is possible
                                to assign some true-false values for the variables in such a way that the statement is
                                true, else the statement is unsatisfiable. It's something like trying to flip a bunch of
                                switches to find the setting that makes a light bulb turn on.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>A propositional statement is simply made up of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>variables</li>
                                <li>brackets</li>
                                <li>and the following 3 symbols</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>¬ meaning not</li>
                                    <li>∧ meaning and</li>
                                    <li>∨ meaning or</li>
                                </ol>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Some examples of statements using these three symbols:</p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <p><span class="red-code">¬</span><span class="key-code">FALSE</span> = <span class="key-code">TRUE</span></p>
                                <p><span class="key-code">False</span> <span class="red-code">∧</span> <span class="key-code">True</span> = <span class="key-code">False</span></p>
                                <p><span class="key-code">False</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> <span class="key-code">True</span> = <span class="key-code">TRUE</span></p>
                            </div>
                            <p>These symbols are also known as logical connectives. They are arranged in order of precedence above.</p>

                            <p>Here is a example of a propositional statement. See if you can find an assignment for the variables a, b, c and d to make the propositional statement true. To see a solution, click the solve button.</p>

                            <h2>Conjunctive Normal Form</h2>
                            <p>
                                Before we get to SAT solvers we need to figure out how to represent propositional
                                statements in a way that a SAT solver can understand it. This is where Conjunctive Normal
                                Form (CNF) comes in. CNF is used as input for SAT solvers.
                            </p>

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                A formula in conjunctive normal form consists of:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>clauses joined by ∧ (and)</li>
                                <li>each clause, in turn consists of variables joined by ∨ (or)</li>
                                <li>A variable can be preceded by a ¬ (not) to negate a variable.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Here is example of a CNF:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <p>
                                    (<span class="blue-code">a</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> </span><span class="blue-code">b</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> <span class="blue-code">c</span>) <span class="red-code">∧</span>
                                    (<span class="red-code">¬</span><span class="blue-code">a</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> </span><span class="red-code">¬</span><span class="blue-code">b</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> <span class="blue-code">c</span>) <span class="red-code">∧</span>
                                    (<span class="blue-code">a</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> </span><span class="red-code">¬</span><span class="blue-code">b</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> <span class="blue-code">c</span>) <span class="red-code">∧</span>
                                    (<span class="red-code">¬</span><span class="blue-code">a</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> </span><span class="blue-code">b</span> <span class="red-code">∨</span> <span class="red-code">¬</span><span class="blue-code">c</span>)
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                But you might be asking why CNF. Here are two reasons why:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Input-related reason: Electronic circuit logic can be converted to CNF in linear time
                                    and space.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Solver-related: Most SAT solver variants can understand CNF. This is because it is
                                    easy to detect conflicts, it is easy to remember assignments that don't work, and
                                    its easy to be translated into simple data structures.

                                Now you might want to start making your own CNFs and using a SAT solver to solve them,
                                right? Great! There is just one more thing, though the above propositional statement is
                                in CNF form this is not quite how inputs for SAT solvers look like. The format most SAT
                                solvers use is called the DIMACS CNF.

                                Here is the above CNF formatted in DIMACS CNF format:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <p>p cnf 3 4</p>
                                <p>1 2 3 0</p>
                                <p>-1 -2 3 0</p>
                                <p>1 -2 -3 0</p>
                                <p>-1 2 -3 0</p>
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Lets break it down:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The first line is the problem line, hence it starts with a p. It tells us three
                                    things about the problem:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The problem is in conjunctive normal form indicted by the cnf.</li>
                                        <li>The problem has 3 variables indicated by the 3.</li>
                                        <li>The problem has 4 clauses indicated by the 4.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Each proceeding line is a clause made up of variables represented as integers.
                                    Each variable is separated by a space and a negated variable is represented as a
                                    negative integer.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Each clause is also terminated with a <span class="small-code">0</span>. This allows
                                    more than one clause appear on the same line.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                This is enough for you to make your own DIMACS CNF, but there are a few more details

                            <h2>SAT Solvers</h2>
                            <p>
                                So what is a SAT solver? A SAT solver is a algorithm that can solve some, but not all
                                instances of SAT. There are two classifications of SAT solvers:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Complete</li>
                                    <li>Incomplete</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A complete SAT solver will always tell you if a problem is satisfiable or unsatisfiable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Incomplete SAT solvers, on the other hand, are less reliable. They may be unable to
                                prove unsatisfiability (when it’s impossible for the formula to yield true), or unable
                                to find a solution when the formula is satisfiable. Incomplete SAT solvers are a lot
                                more useful in scenarios when the instances of SAT cannot be solved by complete
                                algorithms in reasonable time.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                To compare the performance between different SAT solvers, we give them a large set of
                                formulas and see how well each performs. The set of formulas is often referred to as a
                                benchmark instance. A solver previously lost to another solver may do better if
                                different type of benchmark instances are used.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Many modern SAT solvers are based on the original DPLL algorithm designed in the 60’s
                                which is a complete algorithm. Our SAT solver is not based on the original DPLL algorithm,
                                but instead uses genetic algorithms (GA) to find an answer. In summary it guesses the first
                                assignment then evaluates how good the assignment is with a scoring function, the GA then
                                tries to evolve assignments with better scores. Our GA SAT solver is a incomplete SAT solver.
                                If you would like to know why it is not complete or just learn more about GA SAT solvers
                                please read the academic article which our SAT solver is based on.

                                Though we only scratched the surface of SAT and SAT solving it should be enough for you
                                to get started. If you would like to submit your own CNF to be solved you can do it
